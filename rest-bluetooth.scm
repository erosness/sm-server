;;; cube-server bluetooth:

;;; because things are getting a little more complex. the BT-notifier
;;; thread will read from the BTM720's UART on ttymxc3. Here, the BT
;;; unit will tell us the sampling rate of the incoming data
;;; (IND:-S48000Hz). This sampling-rate needs to be passed to cplay on
;;; the command-line in order for things to work (cplay can't detect
;;; this on its own :(). For that reason, the turi-adapter and the
;;; bt-notifier need to communicate and probably are best grouped
;;; together in this file.
;;;
;;; - TODO: bt-notifier must set sampling-rate as well as song title etc
;;; - TODO: bluetooth turi adapter must construct cplay command with sampling-rate
;;; - TODO: restart cplay when Bluetooth sampling rates changes

;; ==================== BT NOTIFIER ====================
;;
;; we get one line per item-notification from the BT agent. it
;; typically send this across the UART:
;;
;; IND:-A1Happiness
;; IND:-A2JÃ³nsi & Alex
;; IND:-A3Riceboy Sleeps
;; IND:-A7561000ms
;;
;; these are our BT UART assumptions:
;;
;; 1. we don't know that the order is the same
;; 2. we don't know the timings of each line
;; 3. we don't expect a lot of lines coming in from the BT module
;;
;; wanting to be as robust as possible, we read line by line and pick
;; up song/artist/album into a state (like bt-notifier-artist). on
;; each line we update our state, and send the aggregated state to our
;; client because:
;;
;; the clients have a limitation: sending notifications with only
;; title and no subtitle, for example, will clear the subtitle field
;; in the display - so we can't send title alone.
;;
;; step 3 above means it should be safe to send one notify! on each
;; line (there are few of them and only when user changes
;; song/connects/disconnects.
;;
;; we also merge in the current (player-information) in the
;; notification, this prevents us from losing the static fields, most
;; noticeably 'image' and 'type' in the ui.
;;
;; parse lines like:
;; (IND-decompose "IND:-A1The Ludlows")
;; (IND-decompose "IND:-A2James Horner")
;; (IND-decompose "IND:-A3Legends Of The Fall Original Motion Picture Soundtrack")
