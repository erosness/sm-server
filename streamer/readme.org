* Streamer

audio-daemon-to-be

The idea:
Input: url or filename of mp3/aac or some compressed audio
Output: decoded audiostream to network or some audio-driver

Something like one streamer-process per Zone.

** TODO
*** resample output to fixed sampleformat
*** manage planar sample-formats (we currently lose a channel)
*** android
**** compile & deploy streamer for Android (ffmpeg deps)
**** compile & deploy ffmpeg for Android
**** settle for an output API (OpenSL ES?)
